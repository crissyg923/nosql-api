## Description
This application was built using MongoDB to create a social networking API that utilizes CRUD operations to handle data.  It allows you to create users, add friends to the users, allows users to share thoughts, and allows other users to react to those thoughts.  It is a basic building block for a full-stack social networking application.

## Installation
Head to the [nosql-api](https://github.com/crissyg923/nosql-api) repository to clone the repo. Once in your local environment, run **"npm i"** in the terminal to install the necessary dependencies. Then, command **"npm run seed && run npm start"** to seed the database and to start the server at a local port(default is 3001). Use an API developing app like Insomnia to test out the routes to create, read, update, and delete users along with their thoughts and add friends/reactions.

## Usage
This application can be used as a base for creating an actual social network that allows people to share their lives with the world and devlop networks of friends and associates.

## Credits
Rutgers tutors, MDN web docs, and class activities helped in the creation of this project.

## How to Contribute
Although a simple API, this project is easily scalable and has the potential for many further developments.  Developing a front-end, adding further features such as image uploading and private messaging, or turning it into an installable app would all be great starts for future development.
